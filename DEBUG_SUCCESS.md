# Debug Setup Successfully Fixed! ðŸŽ‰

## Current Status
âœ… **Plugin is properly linked from the correct directory**
âœ… **Dependencies are correctly bundled**
âœ… **Debug mode is running on port 9229**

## How to Debug Now

### Option 1: Chrome DevTools (Currently Running)
Since `npm run start:debug` is already running:
1. Open Chrome
2. Navigate to `chrome://inspect`
3. Click "inspect" under the Remote Target for your plugin
4. Set breakpoints and debug!

### Option 2: VS Code
1. Stop the current debug process: `Ctrl+C` in terminal
2. Open VS Code
3. Press `F5` or go to Run > Start Debugging
4. Select "Debug Stream Deck Plugin" configuration

### Option 3: Watch Mode (Development)
```bash
npm run watch
```
This will automatically rebuild and restart the plugin when you make changes.

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **Directory Path Issue**: Re-linked plugin from correct location
2. **Native Dependencies**: Configured rollup to externalize native modules
3. **Node Modules**: Added automatic copy of node_modules to plugin directory during build
4. **TypeScript Config**: Updated for proper ES module generation

## Important Notes

- The `npm run build` command now automatically copies node_modules to the plugin directory
- Native dependencies (@stoprocent/noble) cannot be bundled and must be loaded at runtime
- Debug port is set to 9229 - make sure no other process is using this port

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Build and prepare plugin
npm run build

# Start debugging
npm run start:debug

# Watch mode with auto-restart
npm run watch

# Restart plugin manually
streamdeck restart com.cael-gomes.bt-controller

# View logs
tail -f com.cael-gomes.bt-controller.sdPlugin/logs/*.log
```

Happy debugging! ðŸš€
